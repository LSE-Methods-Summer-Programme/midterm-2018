You will need to load the core library for the course textbook and libraries for LDA and KNN:
```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
library(class)
```

This question should be answered using the `Weekly` data set, which is part of the `ISLR` package. This data contains 1,089 weekly stock returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 2010.

1.   Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of the `Weekly` data. Do there appear to be any patterns?

```{r}
data(Weekly)
names(Weekly)
dim(Weekly)
summary(Weekly)
#plot(Weekly)
pairs(Weekly)
cor(subset(Weekly, select = -Direction))
```

2.  Use the full data set to perform a logistic regression with `Direction` as the response and the five lag variables plus `Volume` as predictors. Use the summary function to print the results. 

```{r}
glm.fits <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume, data = Weekly ,family = binomial)
summary(glm.fits)
# The following codes do not give '*'s:
#summary(glm.fits)$coefficients
#summary(glm.fits)$coefficients[, 4]
#coef(glm.fits)
```

  Do any of the predictors appear to be statistically significant? If so, which ones?

**`Lag2` seems to be statistically significant, since it has a relatively small p-value, while all the others' p-values are too big to give a clear evidence of a real association with `Direction`.**

3.  Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. 

```{r}
contrasts(Weekly$Direction)
glm.probs <- predict(glm.fits, type = "response")
#glm.probs[1:10]
glm.pred <- rep("Down", length(glm.probs))
glm.pred[glm.probs > 0.5] <- "Up"
table(glm.pred, Weekly$Direction)
mean(glm.pred == Weekly$Direction)
```
     
  Explain what the confusion matrix is telling you about the types of mistakes made by logistic regression.

**In this case, logistic regression correctly predicted the movement of the stock ``r sprintf("%.2f %%", 100*mean(glm.pred == Weekly$Direction))`` of the time. The confusion matrix, with the off-diagonals representing incorrect predictions including false positives and false negatives, is telling me that the training error is high.**

4.  Now fit the logistic regression model using a training data period from 1990 to 2008, with `Lag2` as the only predictor. 

```{r}
train <- (Weekly$Year < 2009)
Weekly.test <- Weekly[!train, ]
Weekly.train <- Weekly[train, ]
glm.fits.subset <- glm(Direction ~ Lag2, data = Weekly ,family = binomial, subset = train)
summary(glm.fits.subset)
#glm.fits.train <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume, data = Weekly.train ,family = binomial)
#summary(glm.fits.train)
```


  Compute the confusion matrix and the overall fraction of correct predictions for the held out data (that is, the data from 2009 and 2010).

```{r}
glm.probs.test <- predict(glm.fits.subset, Weekly.test, type = "response")
glm.pred.test <- rep("Down", length(glm.probs.test))
glm.pred.test[glm.probs.test > 0.5] <- "Up"
table(glm.pred.test, Weekly.test$Direction)
mean(glm.pred.test == Weekly.test$Direction)
```

**Here, logistic regression correctly predicted the movement of the stock ``r sprintf("%.2f %%", 100*mean(glm.pred.test == Weekly.test$Direction))`` of the time**

5.  Experiment with different combinations of predictors, including possible transformations and interactions, and classification methods. 

    Report the variables, method, and associated confusion matrix that appears to provide the best results on the held out data.
    
**Firstly, try all the combinations of predictors:**

```{r}
predictors <- names(Weekly)[2: 7]
# Getting all combinations of predictors:
boolcombinations <- expand.grid(rep(list(c(TRUE, FALSE)), length(predictors)))
boolcombinations <- boolcombinations[-(dim(boolcombinations)[1]), ]
combinations <- apply(boolcombinations, 1, function(x) as.formula(
  paste("Direction ~ ", paste(predictors[x], collapse = " + "), sep ="")
  ))
# Getting all glm:
allresults <- lapply(combinations, function(x) glm(x, data = Weekly ,family = binomial))
allresults[[1]]$aic  # Verify that this AIC has the same value as in Q2
min(as.numeric(lapply(allresults, function(x) x$aic)))
# Finding the best combination:
wantedcombination <- which.min(as.numeric(lapply(allresults, function(x) x$aic)))
combinations[wantedcombination]
```

**So, according to AIC, the best combination of predictors is ``r predictors[unlist(boolcombinations[wantedcombination, ])]``, for logistic regression. Now, try to find the best combination regarding the error rate, with data prior to 2009 as training set:**

```{r}
allresults.train <- lapply(combinations, function(x) glm(x, data = Weekly ,family = binomial, subset = train))
allprobs <- lapply(allresults, function(x) predict(x, Weekly.test, type = "response"))
allpred <- vector("list", length = length(allprobs))
#allpred <- lapply(allpred, function(x) unlist(x))
#allpred[1] <- list(rep("Down", dim(Weekly.test)[1]))
allpred[c(1:length(allpred))] <- list(rep("Down", dim(Weekly.test)[1]))
for (i in 1:length(allpred)) {
  for (j in 1:dim(Weekly.test)[1]) {
    if (allprobs[[i]][j] > 0.5) {
      allpred[[i]][j] <- "Up"
    }
  }
}
allmean <- lapply(allpred, function(x) mean(x == Weekly.test$Direction))
allmean[1]  # This should be the same as Q4, verified.
wantedcombination.byrate <- which.max(allmean)
combinations[wantedcombination.byrate]
```

**The code above is showing that ``r as.character(combinations[wantedcombination.byrate])`` is the best logistic regression.**
