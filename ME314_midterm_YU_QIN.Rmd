You will need to load the core library for the course textbook and libraries for LDA and KNN:
```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
library(class)
```

This question should be answered using the `Weekly` data set, which is part of the `ISLR` package. This data contains 1,089 weekly stock returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 2010.

1.   Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of the `Weekly` data. Do there appear to be any patterns?

2.  Use the full data set to perform a logistic regression with `Direction` as the response and the five lag variables plus `Volume` as predictors. Use the summary function to print the results. 

    Do any of the predictors appear to be statistically significant? If so, which ones?

3.  Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. 
     
    Explain what the confusion matrix is telling you about the types of mistakes made by logistic regression.

4.  Now fit the logistic regression model using a training data period from 1990 to 2008, with `Lag2` as the only predictor. 

    Compute the confusion matrix and the overall fraction of correct predictions for the held out data (that is, the data from 2009 and 2010).


5.  Experiment with different combinations of predictors, including possible transformations and interactions, and classification methods. 

    Report the variables, method, and associated confusion matrix that appears to provide the best results on the held out data.
